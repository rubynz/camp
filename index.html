              We're back in Wellington for 2016 at the fantastic YMCA Camp Kaitoke.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tickets are NZ$350 (or NZ$200 for students or unwaged). They include accommodation, 3 meals a day &amp; snacks for the duration of the camp and a bus there and back.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have arranged for 3 buses to leave from the <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Wellington+Railway+Station/@-41.2780678,174.7755615,15z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1swellington+train+station!3m1!1s0x6d38ae2c3f4dd7b9:0x1d00ef622515eb70?hl=en">Wellington Central Rail Station</a> at staggered times: 2:30pm, 4:00pm, and 6:00pm. When you're buying your ticket don't forget to <i>additionally</i> select a Bus Ticket for the time you're interested in, if you don't need a ride don't select a Bus Ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 6pm option is primarily for those arriving from out of town, particularly Australia, and can't get in any earlier. So please pick an earlier bus if you can.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will get you back into Wellington by 12pm on the Monday at the latest.

              <h4>Dinner Upgrade</h4>
              <p>
                New Zealand Rails Camps have a reputation of great food and camps overseas are trying to catch up, we want to make things harder for them by stepping it up another level. We’re already getting a great local caterer in, but are currently looking at the bottom level of what they can provide us. This upgrade means we can bump up one of our dinners to be super duper! <a href="images/upgrades/dinner_1.png">This is an example of what we are trying for</a>.

              <p>
                One of the things we have to factor into the ticket price is the agent fees, but not for this camp we don't! Lil Regie are supporting the community by waiving their fees making everyone's tickets a little bit cheaper :-)

In fact we pass on all of the costs of getting power to your place, without any mark-up – that’s generation, distribution, transmission and metering – and then charge you a transparent fee to be your retailer. So, you can relax knowing exactly who you are paying for what. It's honest and fair.

            <h3>The Code</h3>

            <p>
              Rails Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free camp experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>We do not tolerate harassment of Rails Camp participants in any form.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Harassment includes but is not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion.</li>
              <li>sexual imagery.</li>
              <li>deliberate intimidation.</li>
              <li>stalking.</li>
              <li>unwanted following.</li>
              <li>harassing photography or recording.</li>
              <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
              <li>inappropriate physical contact.</li>
              <li>unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate anywhere within the camp venue, including during talks or in supporting materials such as slides or handouts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images or material, either in person or in handouts or other collateral. Sponsor staff and representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing or costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                If camp participants violate these rules, including engaging in harassing behaviour, the camp organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the camp with no refund. This may include a temporary or permanent ban from future Rails Camp events.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising committee immediately.  A camp organising team member can be identified by their red Rails Camp t-shirt.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rails Camp will be happy to provide escorts, help participants contact police, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the camp.
            </p>

            <p>
              We expect participants to follow these rules at all camp venues, on the journey to and from the camp and at any related social activities.
            </p>
